# Managing Relevance AI Agents

Skill for creating, configuring, running, and debugging Relevance AI agents.

> **📚 Full API Documentation:** If MCP tools don't cover your use case, see `https://api-{region}.stack.tryrelevance.com/latest/documentation` (replace `{region}` with your project's region)

## When to Use

- Creating new agents
- Attaching tools/actions to agents
- Writing or updating system prompts
- Configuring agent memory (persistence across tasks)
- Setting up triggers (email, LinkedIn, webhooks, etc.)
- Running agent tasks
- Debugging agent execution issues

## Resource URLs

The following tools return a `url` field in their response pointing directly to the correct page in the Relevance AI app. **Always share this URL with the user immediately after the operation completes.**

| Tool                      | URL points to                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `relevance_create_agent`  | Agent instructions edit page |
| `relevance_update_agent`  | Agent instructions edit page |
| `relevance_publish_agent` | Agent instructions edit page |
| `relevance_trigger_agent` | Agent task page              |

The URL is already constructed with the correct region and project ID — just present it to the user.

## Critical Rules

### Draft-First Editing — Publish Is Always Explicit

The MCP tools mirror the builder app's draft / publish split. **Every edit saves to a draft. Publishing is always a separate, user-confirmed step.**

- **Creating a new agent** (`relevance_create_agent`): saves to a DRAFT. The new agent has a `draft_version_id` and no `active_version_id` until you call `relevance_publish_agent`. `relevance_trigger_agent` defaults to draft, so the agent is testable as soon as creation returns.
- **Updating an existing agent** (`relevance_update_agent` or `relevance_attach_tools_to_agent`): saves to a DRAFT. The previously-published "live" version remains untouched until you explicitly publish. `relevance_update_agent` deep-merges your patch into the current draft, so you only need to send the fields you want to change.
- **Going live**: call `relevance_publish_agent`. This always shows an approval card to the user — even when auto-approve is on. Do not call publish without first asking the user "want me to publish this?" in chat.
- **Testing the draft**: `relevance_trigger_agent` (and `_sync`) defaults to the draft when one exists, so you can run the in-progress version without affecting production. The response includes `triggered_version` so you can tell the user which version actually ran.
- **Restoring a previous version**: `relevance_list_agent_versions` to find the version_id, `relevance_get_agent_version` to inspect it, then `relevance_restore_agent_version` to bring it back as a fresh draft (followed by `relevance_publish_agent` to make it live).

#### Reading an agent while a draft exists

`relevance_get_agent` and `relevance_get_agent_tools` default to the unpublished draft when one exists, mirroring the builder app — so the LLM and the user are looking at the same thing. The response's `viewed_version` field tells you what you read (`"draft"`, `"active"`, or a specific `version_id`), alongside `active_version_id`, `draft_version_id`, and `has_unpublished_draft`.

**When `viewed_version` is `"draft"`, say so to the user explicitly** — e.g. "I'm looking at the unpublished draft — there are unsaved changes here that aren't live yet." This matters because anything you propose is rooted in the draft, not the live config; the user needs to know the baseline before approving edits or asking you to publish.

If the user wants to see what's currently live or compare draft vs live, re-fetch with `version: "active"` and narrate the diff. Do not silently mix draft and live config in the same response — pick one and label it.

### Sub-Agents are DEPRECATED

> ⚠️ **Do NOT add agents to another agent's `actions` array.** This pattern is deprecated.
>
> Use **Workforces** instead for multi-agent orchestration. See [Workforce Documentation](../managing-relevance-workforces/SKILL.md).

### Actions Require project/region (CRITICAL)

Every action MUST include `project` and `region` fields:

```typescript
{
  chain_id: "tool-id",
  project: config.project,    // Your project ID
  region: "f1db6c",           // Tool's region - MAY DIFFER FROM PROJECT!
  title: "My Tool",
  action_behaviour: "never-ask"
}
```

**CRITICAL:** The `region` must be **where the tool exists**, not your project's region!

- Find correct region by checking working agents or tool metadata
- Wrong region = tools silently fail to attach (empty chains)
- See [actions.md](actions.md) for how to find correct region

### Autonomy Settings

```typescript
{
  autonomy_limit: 50,                              // Max tool calls
  autonomy_limit_behaviour: "terminate-conversation"  // Valid: "ask-for-approval" | "terminate-conversation"
}
```

**Note:** `"stop"` is NOT valid for `autonomy_limit_behaviour` - use `"terminate-conversation"`.

Missing project/region causes cloning failures and tool execution errors.

### Action IDs for System Prompts (Two-Pass Required!)

If the agent has any attached tools, the second pass is **required** — weave `{{_actions.<id>}}` references inline into the system_prompt prose where each tool is used. The runtime substitutes each pill for the real function-call name; the prompt editor renders them as clickable pill chips. Plain prose like "use the Google Search tool" produces no pill and gives the LLM a weak tool-selection cue.

```
Pass 1: Create agent + attach tools + placeholder prompt   (saved to draft)
Pass 2: Fetch real action IDs → Update prompt with pills   (saved to draft)
```

**Why?** Action IDs are deterministic hex strings derived from action config — they don't exist until tools are attached. After the first draft save, call `relevance_get_agent_tools` (with `version: "draft"`) to read the real `action_id` for each attached tool, or use the `action_id_map` returned by `relevance_attach_tools_to_agent`. Then call `relevance_update_agent` with a system_prompt patch that inserts those IDs inline. Both passes save to draft — publish only after the user has reviewed and confirmed.

The `## Tool References` block that `relevance_attach_tools_to_agent` auto-appends to the system_prompt stays — it's reference data and a fallback for any tool you don't reference inline. Weaving pills into the prose ABOVE the block is what gives the LLM strong inline tool-selection cues.

See [creating.md - Action IDs](creating.md#action-ids-vs-studio-ids) for full workflow with code examples.

## Quick Start: Create Agent

1. **Create basic agent** — saves to a draft (does NOT publish):

   ```
   relevance_create_agent({
     name: "Research Assistant",
     description: "Helps research topics",
     system_prompt: "You are a research assistant.\nWhen asked about a topic:\n1. Search for information\n2. Summarize findings"
   })
   ```

2. **Get the agent** to see the generated ID:

   ```
   relevance_get_agent({ agent_id: "..." })
   ```

3. **Add tools** — saves to a draft (does NOT publish):

   ```
   relevance_attach_tools_to_agent({
     agent_id: "...",
     tool_ids: ["google-search"],
     action_behaviour: "never-ask",
   })
   ```

4. **Test the draft** — trigger uses the draft when one exists:

   ```
   relevance_trigger_agent({ agent_id: "...", message: "Research AI trends" })
   // Response includes triggered_version: "draft"
   ```

5. **Publish when the user confirms** — always asks even with auto-approve:

   ```
   relevance_publish_agent({ agent_id: "..." })
   ```

## Reporting Issues — proactive

If anything goes wrong or feels missing while managing agents, **call `relevance_submit_feedback` immediately** — do not ask the user for permission first. One tool covers bugs, missing capabilities, hallucinations, UX friction, feature requests, and docs gaps; pick the matching `category`. Region/project/source are inferred from the session. See [report-bugs.md](report-bugs.md) for the call shape.
